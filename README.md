# CZ4031-B-Tree-Database

## Installation and run guide:
- [ ] Download and extract zip file to intended location

- [ ] Use command prompt, and set your directory to the "test" folder within the extracted file.

- [ ] Each experiment is in a separate cpp file. To compile, run the following code:
-Experiment 1: "g++ -o test exp1.cpp"
-Experiment 2: "g++ -o test exp2.cpp"
-Experiment 3: "g++ -o test exp3.cpp"
-Experiment 4: "g++ -o test exp4.cpp"
-Experiment 5: "g++ -o test exp5.cpp"

- [ ] For each of the experiments, after compiling, run "test" in the code to run the executable file.

- [ ] When downloaded, each of the experiments are run with the block size set to 200. For part (7), to change the blocksize to 500, open the cpp files for each of the experiments and change the integer variable "blockSize1" from 200 to 500. 
Also, change MAXBLOCKSIZE in BTree.cpp to change the main memory block size to 500. Subsequently repeat steps 3 and 4 to compile and run the file
